# File Compression Engine (From Scratch)

This repository documents my journey of building a file compression tool from scratch using JavaScript (Node.js).

The goal is not just to compress files, but to deeply understand:
- How data is represented as bytes
- How compression algorithms work internally
- Performance and memory tradeoffs
- Systems-level thinking

## Why This Project
Most developers use compression tools without understanding how they work.
This project forces me to implement the core ideas myself, starting from basic string algorithms and building up to real file compression.

## Project Structure
- `playground/` – Small experiments and practice problems
- `notes/` – Explanations, diagrams, and learning notes
- `src/` – Core compression logic
- `benchmarks/` – Performance and compression ratio tests

## Current Status
**Week 0 – Project setup**
- Repository initialized
- Learning plan defined
- Tooling and structure prepared

## Roadmap
- Study data representation and binary files
- Implement frequency analysis
- Build Huffman encoding and decoding
- Optimize performance and memory usage
- Add CLI interface and benchmarks

## Reflection
This repository is intentionally iterative.
Code quality, explanations, and structure will improve week by week as my understanding deepens.
